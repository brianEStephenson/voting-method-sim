# voting-method-sim

The point of this project is to compare different single winner voting methods
The current methods implemented are:
* Plurality (First Past the Post)
	- the system most commonly used in the US
* Approval Voting
	- voters vote for all candidates they approve of

Current issues include:
- candidate dragging has issues
- results table does not update
